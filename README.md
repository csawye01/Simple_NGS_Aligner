# Simple_NGS_Aligner
A very basic Next Generation sequence aligner that take into account circular DNA and produces a consensus sequence and coverage at each position. This will only allow matching of reads that are 100% matching or only have 1 indel/SNP and has an average PHRED score over 20. This is useful for small genome sequencing results, such as plasmids, that are expected to match the reference quite well. The consensus sequence produced at the end concatenates the gaps and can be seen when put into an alignment program. The fastq files must be trimmed before running the program.
